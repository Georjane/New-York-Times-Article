The New York Times has been a leader in experimenting with the inclusion of multimedia content in traditional stories. That creates all kinds of interesting position questions.

It has as main sections

- Navigation bar
  Designed using grid systems with fixed position and vertical alignment.

- Main Article Section
  Containing articles, list elements, an embeddedd video & images all using grid system layout.

- Aside Section
  Designed with a grid system containing anchor elements and horizontal lines

- Footer
  Grid system layout and flex boxes are used with necessary alignments. It also includes a bottom bar whose position is fixed at the bottom too.

## Built With
