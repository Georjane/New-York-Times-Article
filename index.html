          <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
            and
            a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond the
            world of known physics.<br><br>

            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created
            in
            the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
            hitch
            in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that
            exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
            violent instant.<br><br>

            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
            and
            not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
            irregularities.
            Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.<br><br>

            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around
            it.<br><br>


            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
            Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.<br><br>

            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
            Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
            detected
            ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
            They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that
            Dr. Guth was correct.<br><br>


            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
            whether it could ever be proved.<br><br>

            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery
            of
            dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and
            space and energy to science and speculation.<br><br>

            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with
            its
            hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
            architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number
            of
            other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.<br><br>



            <b>‘As Big as It Gets’</b><br><br>

            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
            reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
            would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.<br><br>

            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
            said,
            “This is huge, as big as it gets.”<br><br>

            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
            gravitational
            waves.”<br><br>

            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
            space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of
            the
            sun.<br><br>

            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
            Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics
            here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

          <h4>The Theory of Inflation</h4>
          <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
            which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in the
            instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

          <span><b>THE UNIVERSE</b> is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we
            can
            observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look,
            the universe has an even temperature.</span>
          <span><b>NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from
            one
            side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold
            to mix into an even temperature.</span>
          <span><b>DISTANT COFFEE</b> At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You
            see a
            coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has
            cooled.</span>
          <span><b>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</b> Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a similar
            coffee cup,
            at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you
            might want to look for another explanation</span>

        </div>
        <div class="image_details_two">
          <span><b>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</b> There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place
            to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all
            at the same time, that might explain their even temperature</span>
          <span><b>INFLATION</b> solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth of
            a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the
            violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.</span>
          <span><b>FLUCTUATION</b> Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations in
            swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from the early
            universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.</span>
          <span><b>EXPANSION</b> Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding
            faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And
            the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.</span>

        <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.

          Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in
          his lifetime.<br><br>

          “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”<br><br>

          The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing
          email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr.
          Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping
          that night in 1979), in his office last week.<br><br>

          “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his
          words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.<br><br>

          Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known
          as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a
          Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell
          him the news.</p>
